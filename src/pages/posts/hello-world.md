# Hello, World!

This is my first blog post! I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

## Getting Started

To create a new blog post, simply add a new Markdown file in the `src/pages/posts` directory. The file should include frontmatter at the top with the following fields:

- `layout`: The layout component to use (BlogPost.astro)
- `title`: The title of your post
- `date`: The publication date
- `description`: A brief description of the post (optional)
- `image`: A URL to the featured image (optional)

## Markdown Features

You can use all standard Markdown features:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- Lists
- [Links](https://astro.build)
- `Code snippets`
- And more!
